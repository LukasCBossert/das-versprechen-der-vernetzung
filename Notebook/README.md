# Notebook -- Script for the workshop and beyond

In this folder you can find the different versions of the script,
which was used for the workshop to visualize and analyze a network.

Central is the [JupyterNotebook](the-promise-to-partner.ipynb), which has the programming language R as kernel and is the basis for the export to other formats.

<!-- The Markdown version is still cleaned up after conversion, for which [Markdownlint](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint) is used. -->

The [Makefile file](makefile) can be used to generate the various formats:

- [PDF (via LuaLaTeX)](the-promise-to-partner.pdf)
- [org-mode](the-promise-to-partner.org)
- [Markdown](the-promise-to-partner.md)
- [Rscript](the-promise-to-partner.r)
- [Webpage](the-promise-to-partner.html)
- [WebSlides](the-promise-to-partner.slides.html)

Comments, corrections, and suggestions for improvement are welcome
to be submitted as [_Pull Request_](https://github.com/LukasCBossert/das-versprechen-der-vernetzung/pulls)
or entered at [_Issues_](https://github.com/LukasCBossert/das-versprechen-der-vernetzung/issues).

Furthermore you find the solution snippets we used for the Hands-On-Workshop itself:

- [JupyterNotebook](the-promise-to-partner-Workshop.ipynb)
- [Markdown](the-promise-to-partner-Workshop.md)

Thanks to community contribution the JupyterNotebook we used for the workshop is
now available with a Python-Kernel.
