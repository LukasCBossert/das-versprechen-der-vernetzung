# Notebook -- Script for the workshop

In this folder you can find the different versions of the script,
which was used for the workshop to visualize and analyze a network.

Central is the [JupyterNotebook](the-promise-of-networking.ipynb), which has the programming language R as kernel and is the basis for the export to other formats.

<!-- The Markdown version is still cleaned up after conversion, for which [Markdownlint](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint) is used. -->

The [Makefile file](makefile) can be used to generate the various formats:

- [PDF (via LuaLaTeX)](the-promise-to-partner.pdf)
- [org-mode](the-promise-to-partner.org)
- [Markdown](the-promise-of-networking.md)
- [Rscript](the-promise-to-partner.r)
- [Webpage](the-promise-of-networking.html)
- [WebSlides](the-promise-to-partner.slides.html)
- [LaTeX](the-promise-to-partner.tex)
